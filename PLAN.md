# Denver Hide & Seek — tuning plan & status

Fork tuned for one Medium-size Hide & Seek game in the **western Denver metro** on **RTD** transit. Context/decisions: see [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/). Scope: **correctness first (A, B, E, counties); features C/D as stretch.**

## Prerequisite (no app code)
- [x] Convert the 3 Google My Maps KMLs → GeoJSON. Output in [`denver-game/`](denver-game/):
  - `denver-border.hidingzone.json` — the border, emitted in the tool's **save-file shape** (FeatureCollection + `disabledStations:[]` etc.) so it imports via Options → Load without tripping the loader's unguarded `disabledStations.constructor` access. Geometry validated (DEN/Boulder/Colorado Springs out; downtown/Golden/Denver Zoo in).
  - `denver-counties.geojson` — 7 counties, `properties.name` per feature (reference; counties use OSM).
  - `denver-municipalities.geojson` — 36 municipalities incl. "Uninc. <County>" (input for workstream C).
- [ ] In-app: Options → Load `denver-border.hidingzone.json` to set the boundary (`polyGeoJSON`). This is what makes feature queries clip.
- [ ] Counties (1st admin): built-in "same zone" question, **OSM Zone = 6**. Municipalities (2nd): needs workstream C.

## Environment note
The sandbox has **Node 25.9.0** but this project requires **Node <25** (`package.json` engines). Node 25's experimental `localStorage` breaks `@nanostores/persistent` during SSR/prerender, so `astro build`/`astro dev` fail there (confirmed identical on clean `master` — not a regression). Workarounds: use Node <25, or `NODE_OPTIONS="--localstorage-file=/some/path" pnpm build`. The client-rendered app itself runs fine (verified via `astro preview`).

## In-app verification (A+B+E, via `astro preview`)
- Measuring picker: 26 options, void types **absent** (Coastline, Commercial Airport, Major City, High-Speed Rail); Aquarium **kept** (distance).
- Matching picker: 27 options, **absent** Commercial Airport, Major City, Aquarium (both variants); Zone/Custom/stations retained.
- New-question default is **Mountain** (peak-full), not the hidden airport/coastline.
- Questions run + render end-to-end; the ≥1000-results guard fires on country-scale maps (expected; bounded on the Denver polygon).

## Workstreams

### A — Boundary-bypass fix — ✅ DONE (verified)
Feature queries no longer leak out-of-bounds instances, and the runaway search loop can't hang.
- `overpass.ts`: added `boundaryPolyClause()`; `findTentacleLocations` now clips to `polyGeoJSON`; `nearestToQuestion` is capped (bbox-diagonal + margin) and returns `null` when a type has no in-bounds instance.
- `matching.ts` / `measuring.ts`: `hiderify*` guard the `null` (void) case.
- `ZoneSidebar.tsx`: guarded the `null`, capped the duplicate loop, skip station when nothing in-bounds.
- Verified: `tsc` introduces 0 new errors (10 pre-existing, unrelated); `vitest` 17/17 pass.

### B — Hide void questions — ✅ DONE (verified)
- `matching.tsx` / `measuring.tsx`: filter the schema-driven picker via `HIDDEN_MATCHING_TYPES` / `HIDDEN_MEASURING_TYPES` (airport, major-city/city, high-speed rail, coastline).
- `schema.ts`: repointed the two ordinary-question defaults off the now-hidden `airport`/`coastline` → `peak-full`.

### E — Minor accuracy — ✅ DONE (verified)
- Foreign consulate: new `LOCATION_EXTRA_FILTER` in `constants.ts` appends `["consulate"!="honorary_consul"]` at all 3 query sites → keeps the 2 real (Mexico, Perú), drops honorary.
- Aquarium: matching variant hidden (folded into `HIDDEN_MATCHING_TYPES`); distance-to-aquarium kept.
- `-full` measuring variants are the boundary-safe ones shown by default.

Verification for A+B+E: `tsc` 0 new errors (10 pre-existing), `vitest` 17/17, Prettier clean, ESLint clean.

### C — Municipality named-zone matching type — ✅ DONE (verified)
New `same-named-zone` matching type (see [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-admin-zones-county-osm-municipality-custom.md)):
- `schema.ts`: added `same-named-zone` to `customMatchingQuestionSchema` (reuses `geo`, `same`).
- `matching.ts`: `determineMatchingBoundary` case picks the FeatureCollection feature containing the seeker's marker (no `turf.combine`); `modifyMapData` + the generic hider-mode path handle same/different. Each named zone is one (Multi)Polygon feature, so no name-merging needed.
- `matching.tsx`: "Load zones (GeoJSON)" file import (`handleNamedZoneFile`) sets `data.geo`; type-specific card shows loaded-zone count; picker entry + `onValueChange` reset of stale geo.
- Verified end-to-end in-app: type persists/reparses, picker shows it, importing a FeatureCollection narrows the map to the seeker's named zone (synthetic 2-zone test cut the boundary exactly at the zone divide). 0 new type errors, 17/17 tests, lint clean.
- **To use:** add a Matching question → type "Same Named Zone (e.g. Municipality)" → Load zones (GeoJSON) → pick `denver-game/denver-municipalities.geojson`.
- ⚠️ Caveat: that file is ~2.3 MB; it's stored inline in the question (localStorage + share payloads). Fine for local play; if sluggish or near localStorage limits, simplify/reduce coordinate precision in the converter.

### D — RTD bus + rail transit — ⬜ STRETCH
Wire station matching to the transit selection (`matching.ts:326`, node→nwr); add `route=bus` line matching (ref + network=RTD); **nearest-stop via bounded query** (4,473 stops > 1,000-element guard). See [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-model-rtd-bus-lines.md).

## Verification
`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` (expect 10 pre-existing errors) · `pnpm exec vitest run` (17 tests).
